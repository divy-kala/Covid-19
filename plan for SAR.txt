Steps:

for modelling, need gamma and beta

gamma is known

beta can be found using R0 and gamma

R0 can be found using generation time

generation time is assumed to follow gamma distribution

mean and shape parameter of gamma is estimated using data

How? gridsearch over mean and shape parameter of gamma dist

Get a mean and shape for the distribution and use it to generate generation time :)

Estimate R0 from G using R0 package 

Simulate the disease progression for the period which we observed new incidences and calc MSE

Select the R0 that gave lowest MSE



Design:

Simulate_diesease_progression (beta, gamma, S, I, R, verbose):
	#perhaps use desolve?
	use scipy.integrate's odeint
	return time series

R Module for getting R0 from G

Get_good_R0_and_simulate (time series data with S I R,verbose):
	Gridsearch:
		generate random mean, shape
		Find R0 by calling R module
		Simulate_disease_progression (beta (from R0), gamma(known), S,I,R)
		
		Calculate MSE
	Return R0 with minimum MSE, time series of its simulation
